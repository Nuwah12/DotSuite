The idea of this is to make a matrix of features for each cell line out of a binned genome
This way, when we call dots on Hi-C/Micro-C/HiChIP (eventually), we can filter them based on features present on the linear genome
Sort of like a compendium for by-celltype epigenomic features
This gives meaning to dots called on a matrix  - the nature of these methods obscures the meaning of the loops, as they are commonly presented as dots on the interaction matrix

Two routes:
1. Bin ALL READS from each experiment and have those as values in matrix - this would require some significane determination, and we already have peak calling to do that
2. Demarcate the presence of a peak for the given feature by a '1' and the absence of a peak by a '0' - this seems like the best option

Ex:
		SMC1	CTCF	YY1	Promoter	Enhancer
chr1:1-5000	0	0	0	1		0
chr1:5001:10000	0	1	0	0		0

chrN:X-X+binsize	0	0	0		0
