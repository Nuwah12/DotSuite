## GOALS
The idea of this is to make a matrix of features for each cell line out of a binned genome
This way, when we call dots on Hi-C/Micro-C/HiChIP (eventually), we can filter them based on features present on the linear genome
Sort of like a compendium for by-celltype epigenomic features
This gives meaning to dots called on a matrix  - the nature of these methods obscures the meaning of the loops, as they are commonly presented as dots on the interaction matrix

### 3/26/23
Clustering of genomic bins marked for presence of multiple eipgenomic features
Sample clustering algorithms that work well with binary (1 or 0) data
